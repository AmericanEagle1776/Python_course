The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. 
The first 6 numbers of the Fibonacci series would then be: 1,1,2,3,5,8
You should design a program that calculates the first 1000 numbers of the Fibonacci series (having as the two starting numbers: 1,1)
and saves them in a list that at the end of the program will be printed.
